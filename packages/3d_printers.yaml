      # I use https://github.com/Z-Bolt/OctoScreen to control octoprint via a touch screen directly connected to the raspberry pi
      # GPIO pins. It does have an issue: if the printer is off and thus octoprint is not connected to it, it'll keep trying to connect
      # and it eventually makes octoprint crash (known bug). So this switch is used to disable it alongside the printer power supply.
      # Cool side effect: it'll make octoprint connect to the printer automatically when started.
